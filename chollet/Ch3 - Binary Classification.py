# ### Encoding the integer sequences into a binary matrix

# (From Chollet's book)
# There are two ways to do that:
# - Pad your lists so that they all have the same length, turn them into an integer tensor of shape (samples, word_indices), and then use as the first layer in your network a layer capable of handling such integer tensors (the Embedding layer, which weâ€™ll cover in detail later in the book).
# - One-hot encode your lists to turn them into vectors of 0s and 1s. This would mean, for instance, turning the sequence [3, 5] into a 10,000-dimensional vec- tor that would be all 0s except for indices 3 and 5, which would be 1s. Then you could use as the first layer in your network a Dense layer, capable of handling floating-point vector data.

# Manual implementation for clarity
def vectorize_sequences(sequences, dimension=10000):
    results = np.zeros((len(sequences), dimension))
    for i, sequence in enumerate(sequences):
        results[i, sequence] = 1
    return results


x_train = vectorize_sequences(train_data)
x_test = vectorize_sequences(test_data)
